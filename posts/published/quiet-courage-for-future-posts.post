Story:

Stephen keeps a journal of the tiny rebellions that stack into a life.

He writes before dawn, deleting more than he keeps, trusting that consistency beats sudden flashes of genius.

The courage he leans on is quiet: publish the note, share the draft, ask for the uncomfortable feedback.

Key rituals he returns to:
- Block time for wandering research.
- Track claps only to celebrate the reader, not the ego.
- Ship a paragraph even when the story feels half baked.
