Story:

Stephen maps the drafts he never published.

Some become talks, some whisper into newsletters, and a few hibernate until a better example arrives.

He now keeps a "rituals board" beside his desk:
- Monday mornings celebrate community wins.
- Wednesdays reserve time for structure edits.
- Fridays highlight a reader's question.

Scheduling creativity sounds cold, but the calendar liberates his weekends for real adventures.
